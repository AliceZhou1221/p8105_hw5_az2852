# Problem 1

Suppose you put n people in a room, and want to know the probability
that at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we‚Äôll assume
there are no leap years (i.e.¬†there are only 365 days) and that
birthdays are uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not
the case).

``` r
set.seed(123)

sample = sample(1:365, size = 10, replace = TRUE)

length(unique(sample)) < 10
```

    ## [1] TRUE

write a function

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  
  sample = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)

duplicates = length(unique(sample)) < n

return(duplicates)
}

bday_sim(40)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50. For
each group size, compute the probability that at least two people in the
group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000 simulation
runs.

``` r
bday_sim = expand_grid(
    iter = 1:10000,
    n = 2:50) %>% 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) %>% 
  group_by(n) %>% 
  summarize(
    prob = mean(res)
  )
```

Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size, and
comment on your results.

``` r
ggplot(bday_sim, aes(x = n, y = prob))+
  geom_line()
```

# Problem 2

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected ‚Äì put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

First set the following design elements:

ùë•‚àºùëÅùëúùëüùëöùëéùëô\[ùúá,ùúé\]

For each dataset, save ùúáÃÇ and the p-value arising from a test of ùêª:ùúá=0
using ùõº=0.05

``` r
# write a function that generates a normal vector with n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 5
generate_normal_fixed = function(n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 5) {
  norm_vec = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean, sd = sd)
  return (norm_vec)
}
#check that the function works

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of ùúáon the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
# Calculate the power (proportion of p-values < 0.05) for each true mean
power_df = sim_df %>%
  group_by(pop_mean) %>%
  summarize(power = mean(p.value < 0.05))

# Plot the power against the true mean (effect size)
power_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_mean, y = power)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Power of the One-Sample t-test vs True Mean",
    x = "True Mean (Effect Size)",

  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw5_az2852_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

Power increases as effect size (true mean mu) increases. When the true
mean is close to 0, the power is low (close to the significance level of
0.05). As true mean increases, power approaches 1. The increase in power
appears to be sharp at first and then slows down as power gets close to
1.

Make a plot showing the average estimate of ùúáÃÇ on the y axis and the true
value of ùúáon the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first)
the average estimate of ùúáÃÇ only in samples for which the null was
rejected on the y axis and the true value of ùúáon the x axis. Is the
sample average of ùúáÃÇ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of ùúá? Why or why not?

``` r
# calculate average estimates for all samples and for samples where null was rejected
summary_df = sim_df %>%
  group_by(pop_mean) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_estimate_all = mean(estimate),
    avg_estimate_rejected = mean(estimate[p.value < 0.05])
  )

#plot average estimate against the true mean for all and rejected samples

The average estimate mu_hat for which the null is rejected is not
approximately equal to the true mean. Rather, the average estimates for
rejected samples are higher because only samples with larger estimates
(further from 0) are more likely to reject the null hypothesis.
